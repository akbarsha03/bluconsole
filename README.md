To install, just download the **bluconsole.unitypackage**, install it, and open the window on: Window/BluConsole. Simple like that.

When updating the version, delete the old version and import again. If you want to keep your filters, backup your BluLogSeetings.asset and use it with the new version.

Features Implemented
----------------------------

It has all the UnityConsole features, with a few additions:


#### Search Box

Search through your logs.

#### Callstack Navigation

You can open any line of the call stack with a double click.

#### Log Copy

Right click on the Log, and copy the text to the Clipboard. Simple like that!

#### Custom filters

If you catch yourself filtering always by the same query, just put that in the FilterSettings (BluConsole/Resources/BluConsole/BluLogSettings). Or you can right click on the console header tab and select Add Filter (check images).

#### StackTraceIgnore

If you want to ignore a function in the StackTrace, just put the ```[BluConsole.StackTraceIgnore]``` annotation on it.


TODO
----------------------------

* Improve additional filter editor
* Support for themes (Font size, Colors, etc)

Known Issues
----------------------------

* When filtering logs, the toggles with the number of logs are displayed incorrectly
